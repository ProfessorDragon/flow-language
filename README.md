# flow-language

 Visual coding language based on Python.

Requires Python to run, without any external dependencies. Tested on Windows 11. Made in 2022, so it will likely not be updated except for pull requests.

How to configure Flow as the default program for .flow files:
- `assoc .flow=Flow.File`
- `ftype Flow.File=pythonw "(location of flow.pyw)" "%1"`
